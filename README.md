Roy's Icon : This is a music mixer icons market 


Assignment Requirements
Use Terminal, Git and Github to create the project structure and a linked repository. Create a
minimum of 10 SVG icons in Illustrator - the theme is up to you.
Use CSS to organize the icons on an HTML page with some branding and a (very) brief
description for each. You can choose how you want to implement this - as an image tag source,
as an SVG tag, or using the object tag.
Use CSS interactions or transitions to change the icon’s appearance (on hover, as an example,
reverse all of the colours or add a drop shadow, etc).
When clicked, toggle a “selected” CSS class on the active icon and log a message to the
console with the ID of the element that you’ve clicked. The ID should be retrieved and displayed
with a JavaScript string template and variable (refer to the class example).
Push the finished files to your repo; include a readme that describes the project.
Merge everything to the main branch and submit a link to the dropbox on FOL - a .txt file is
fine.
